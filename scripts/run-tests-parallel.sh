# run-tests-parallel.sh — run every registered test suite as parallel
# processes of the already-built test-runner.
#
# ZERO-LOSS CONTRACT (gate quality must be identical to the sequential run):
#   1. The suite list comes from `test-runner --list-suites`, which is printed
#      by the SAME macro table that executes suites — the list cannot drift
#      from reality by construction.
#   2. UNION GUARD: after the run, the set of suites that actually produced a
#      result is compared against that list; any difference (a suite that
#      never ran, or ran twice) fails the gate loudly. A newly added suite is
#      picked up automatically on the next invocation.
#   3. Per-suite pass/fail/skip counts are summed and reported in the same
#      "N passed[, M failed][, K skipped]" shape as the sequential runner, so
#      before/after totals are directly comparable.
#   4. ANY suite failing, crashing (nonzero exit), or missing ⇒ exit 1.
#
# Usage: run-tests-parallel.sh <path-to-test-runner> [jobs]
