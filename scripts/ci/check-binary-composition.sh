# check-binary-composition.sh — release gate: assert what must NOT be inside a
# shipped artifact.
#
# Microsoft Defender's ML classifier flagged the v0.9.1-rc.1 binaries. The
# hardening pass that followed *removed capability* — an executable stack, an
# in-process updater, test-only environment seams, the embedded HTTP/UI server
# and its process enumerator in the standard build. Each of those regresses
# invisibly: one restored #include, one Makefile source list edit, one revived
# call site, and nothing else in CI notices — the binary just quietly gets its
# malware-shaped surface back and the next release gets flagged again.
#
# This script is the proof that each removal stayed removed. It asserts only
# NEGATIVE properties (needle absent), plus one canary string we know ships,
# because an absence check aimed at the wrong file — a compressed artifact, a
# stub, a truncated download — would otherwise pass vacuously and read green.
# A missing tool is a hard error for the same reason: a skipped assertion must
# never look like a satisfied one.
#
# Usage: scripts/ci/check-binary-composition.sh [--variant=auto|standard|ui] <binary-or-dir>...
#   Directories are scanned recursively; format (ELF / Mach-O / PE) is detected
#   per file from its magic bytes and each assertion runs where it is
#   meaningful. Exit 0 = every assertion passed, 1 = at least one failed,
#   2 = usage error, missing tool, or nothing checkable was found (a vacuous
#   run is a failure, not a pass).

# S6: worker/Windows test seams read these env vars. A release binary that
# still honours them lets any process on the box steer the indexer's child
# processes and file placement — and CBM_TEST_* in a shipped binary is exactly
# the "debug/injection hooks" shape AV heuristics score on.

# malware-shaped behaviour we ever shipped; updates now run from install.sh
# out-of-process. These four needles cover both halves of what was removed:
# the download base URL, the checksum URL built on top of it, the GitHub API
# release query of the daemon's background version check, and that request's
# Accept header (which survives even if the URL is ever assembled at runtime).
