 *   residual            os_committed - live_bytes (other threads, allocator
 *                       retention, or non-allocator memory)
 *
 * Reading the triple localises growth without guessing:
 *   live grows                → leak on this thread's heap; buckets say which size
 *   residual grows, live flat → another thread's heap, retention, or OS/CRT memory
 *   both flat but RSS grows   → mapped files or stacks, not the heap
 *
 * The bucket histogram splits live bytes by size class, so a distinctive class
 * ("thousands of 384-byte blocks appeared") identifies the allocation without
 * per-callsite instrumentation.

 * and "somewhere else" has to be named before it can be fixed. Guessing

 * costs a soak run per guess; asking the OS costs one pass.

 *   GetProcessHeaps + HeapWalk                 → what the CRT heaps hold
 *

 * allocator's arenas and the CRT heaps are both drawn from it, so
 *   committed_private - crt_heap_committed - <arena committed>
 * is the unattributed remainder. A census where that remainder is the part
 * that grows says the leak is in neither heap — which is a different bug from
 * either heap leaking, and points at raw VirtualAlloc or stacks instead.
 *
 * Windows-only; returns false everywhere else so callers must handle absence
 * rather than silently reading zeros as "nothing there".
