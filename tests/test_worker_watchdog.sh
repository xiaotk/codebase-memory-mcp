# test_worker_watchdog.sh — regression guard for the WORKER-mode parent-death
# watchdog (#845). A supervised index worker (`cli --index-worker
# index_repository …`) whose supervisor dies must exit on its own instead of
# indexing on as an orphan (orphaned workers contributed to memory pressure
# during the 2026-07-04 host panics). The MCP-server watchdog (#406/#407,
# tests/test_parent_watchdog.sh) did not cover CLI worker mode.
#
# Strategy: launch the worker under a wrapper "parent" on a fixture where the
# test-only injector (CBM_TEST_HANG_ON) busy-spins on one file, so the worker
# is guaranteed to still be mid-index when the wrapper is killed — the guard
# cannot pass vacuously via the worker simply finishing. The hidden
# --index-worker-single-thread + --index-worker-marker recovery knobs give a
# deterministic "worker is AT the hang file" sync point: the worker writes the
# rel_path it is about to process before touching it. After kill -9 of the
# wrapper, the worker-mode watchdog must notice the changed ppid and kill its
# isolated process group within a few seconds. A test-only worker descendant is
# kept alive in that group to prove teardown is tree-wide rather than merely a
# root-process exit. The recovery knobs are passed as the supervisor's hidden
# worker argv, never by mutating the supervisor environment. Skipped on
# Windows-like shells (the watchdog is POSIX-only).
