# INVERTED release-surface contract: Windows ships ONE binary.
#
# History this guards against. The Windows release used to be a PAIR — a small
# permanent launcher (codebase-memory-mcp.exe) plus the real product binary
# (codebase-memory-mcp.payload.exe). The launcher existed for exactly one
# reason: a running .exe cannot replace its own image on Windows, so an
# in-process self-update needs a second resident binary to do the swap.
#
# That stub is statically indistinguishable from a dropper — a small unsigned
# PE whose whole job is verify-and-execute another binary — and Defender's ML
# scored it Trojan:Win32/Wacatac.B!ml on x64 regardless of what we changed
# (bcrypt-free, stripped, VERSIONINFO'd and even resource-free builds were all
# flagged), while the product binary itself scans clean on every platform.
#
# The fix removed the stub and moved self-update OUT of the process into
# install.ps1, which runs while CBM is NOT running. So this file asserts the
# ABSENCE of the flagged design, plus the one step that replaces it:
# install.ps1 must RETIRE the running binary (rename it out of the way) before
# publishing the new one — losing that step silently breaks every Windows
# update.
#
# The non-launcher release/security assertions from the previous contract
# (VM-driver hardening, archive allowlists, HTTPS-only downloads, profile-rooted
# smoke fixtures, PR-smoke delegation) are preserved below.
